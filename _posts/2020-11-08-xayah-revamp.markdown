Here’s a revamp I did of an old drawing that I came across while browsing through my hard drive a few days ago. 

At first I didn’t know how to approach it, so I just started with the face and winged it from there. The main elements that I wanted to change were the hair, the skull and the feathers - I felt like they needed the most love. I’m overall quite happy with the rather noticeable 2 year progress – and who knows, maybe in another 2 years I’ll come back and do a second revamp, as Xayah is a character whose aesthetic I love, and I’m not ready to let her go just yet.
