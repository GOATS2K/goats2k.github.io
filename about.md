# Hey! ðŸ˜Š

I'm a 20 year old studying Game Art at De Montfort University in Leicester, UK. I do both 2D and 3D work, so you can expect to see bit of both here.

Check out my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/specular_art/) page! 

## Tools I Use

* Modeling: 3DSMax
* Texturing: Photoshop / Substance Painter
* Real-time rendering: Marmoset Toolbag / Unreal Engine 4
* Engines: Unreal Engine 4 / Unity


## Projects I have worked on

* [Fugue](https://devmesh.intel.com/projects/fugue)
* [Solar](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/46/solar)

Both projects were unfortunately dropped by their respective teams, but I have published some of the work I did in the "Projects" tab above.

Thanks for stopping by my portfolio!

*PS: I am also open for commissions.*
